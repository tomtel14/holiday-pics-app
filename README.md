# Holiday Pics App

* Decided to build a simple SPA to show a collection of some of my favourite holiday photos.

* Using plain javascipts I had to work with my array of objects to achieve the desired functionality of the app.

* Features significant logic which enables the user to either filter the images by country or shuffle the images into a new array and browse through them that way.

* Optimised the app by reducing load times by compressing all images.
